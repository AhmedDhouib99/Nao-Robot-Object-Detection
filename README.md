## **Introduction**

In this project we make the humanoid robot able to detect , recognize and name in real time 80 different object by implementing the famous object detection model YOLO in it .

## **Demonstration Video**
You can take look at my project and learn more about it from [here](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ahmed--dhouib_pfa-nao-deeplearning-activity-6943654289353412608-efjF?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) 
## **Requirements**
- The NAO robot ( ofc ) 
- A laptop ( it not necessary to have a camera )
- install the weights and cfg YOLO_V3 files from  [here](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/) ( we used YOLO_V3 but you can choose another version ) 
- install python with the corresponding version indicated in the "aldebaran" website

## **Steps**
1. install python with the corresponding version indicated in the "aldebaran" website
2. Clone this project on your laptop 
3. Add the YOLO files to the same folder 
4. Connect to your Robot 
5. change the names of cfg and weights names in the code ( in case you use another version )
